# DEPRECATED: Flask-based app removed
# This file used to implement a Flask UI (`web/app.py`) but the project now
# uses an async FastAPI application (`web/main.py`). The old Flask code has
# been intentionally removed to avoid confusion. If you need to keep a
# historical copy, restore it from version control history.

raise SystemExit("Deprecated - use FastAPI app at web/main.py")
